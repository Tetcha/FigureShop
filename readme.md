Some rules that this web application needs to follow:

People can view the items, put products or edit the quantity of product in the cart, but only authenticated users (registered accounts) can order and pay. Manager capabilities and client capabilities must be separate. Specifically, the customer, who is the authenticated user, can order and pay for the product, also can review the purchase history. your goods. Manager capabilities include adding products, updating product information, viewing customer order details, and canceling or confirming orders.
